# sample-radar-api-ebs

This is the back-end of a simple app to demonstrate [deploying on Elastic Beanstalk through Shippable](http://docs.shippable.com/autodeploy-to-ebs/). The app shows the age of Github issues and their status. 

Make sure to deploy the [UI repo](https://github.com/shippableSamples/sample-radar-ui-ebs) for the front end. The [document](http://docs.shippable.com/autodeploy-to-ebs/) explains how to deploy the UI component. Use the same steps to deploy this repo as well.
